# [v1.1.2](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/releases/tag/v1.1.2)

IBC-go Security v1.1.2 Patch Release â€“ Immediate Upgrade Required


A patch for [ISA-2025-001](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v) to ibc-go has been released that requires bumping ibc-go to v7.10.0. Therefore a release of v1.1.2 of atomoned was issued to upgrade this dependency.

While this patch is not state-breaking, and the chain can upgrade in a rolling manner which means there is no need for a coordinated upgrade, it is essential that validators upgrade immediately to prevent potential exploitation. It is crucial to acknowledge that If the vulnerability is exploited before 2/3 of validators have patched, the chain will halt.
