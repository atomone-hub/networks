# commit: 90526ee07358a4f34b579e6a1d4573acb830d17b
# cosmos_sdk_version: v0.47.17
# version: v2.0.0
```

### Using cosmovisor 

```sh
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2/bin && cp $HOME/go/bin/atomoned $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2/bin

$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2/bin/atomoned version
```

## Configuration updates

- **Validators** will have to change their configuration to allow the PHOTON denom (`uphoton`) for the fees, **before** the upgrade.
This setting is located in `$DAEMON_HOME/config/app.toml`.

```toml
minimum-gas-prices = "0.025uatone,0.225uphoton"
```

- **Relayer Operators** will also need to update their configuration to use the PHOTON denom for the fees, but this time **after** the upgrade.

Once the chain is upgraded, the setting should be changed to:
```toml
[[ chain ]]
id = 'atomone-1'
(...)
gas_price = { price = 0.225, denom = 'uphoton' }
```

:warning: Ensure wallet have some `uphoton`.

> NOTE: Note that unlike the validator config change which still accepts `uatone` for
> fees, this change should be done **after** the upgrade because it is restricted
> to `uphoton` which has no supply before the upgrade.


### How to mint $PHOTON

```sh
# Mint $ATONE to $PHOTON
atomoned tx photon mint 1000000uatone 
```
