# v1.1.1

the upgrade bumps the ibc-go dependency to address ASA-2025-004 (https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw, https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.0).

This is a state-machine-breaking update which means that a 2/3 of the voting power is required to be on this version for the chain to not be vulnerable.

However, due to the nature of the update (a vulnerability fix) we had to roll out this as an emergency upgrade instead of a on-chain voted chain upgrade.

As also concluded in the vulnerability disclosure, in principle the update can happen on a rolling basis, meaning validators can update as soon as they see this message and there is no practical need for a coordinated upgrade. Therefore, contrary to what planned there will be no coordinated upgrade but validators can instead start upgrading immediately.

However, it is important to note that if the chain is attacked by exploiting the vulnerability in the meantime, the only way to unfreeze the halt will be for 2/3 of the voting power to have upgraded.

Due to issues related to existing modules like - the packet-forwarding-middleware - that is present on the Cosmos Hub, the Ibc-Go team had to release another update v7.9.2 (https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.2 ) while they retracted the v7.9.0 release that was included in v1.1.0 release of  atomoned.
